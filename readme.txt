Add custom JavaScript to the whole website and to specific posts and pages.

== Description ==

WP Add Custom JS allows you to add **custom JS** to the **whole website** and to **individual posts, pages and custom post types** (such as **Woocommerce products**).
The JS rules applied to the whole website will override the default javascript of your theme and plugins, while the JS scripts applied to specific pages, posts or custom post types.

You can edit the main JS from the the "Add custom JS" settings page.
The plugin also creates a new "Custom JS" box in the editing area to **add custom JS to specific posts, pages and custom post types**.
